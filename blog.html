                    <p>Recently I had another scare as a result of my eating disorder as my electrolytes crashed. I had just been in hospital for over a month due to my depression and while there my physical needs were not met, as I was there for a mental health issue. What I mean by this is that despite my Anorexia being a mental condition, it has physical symptoms and these also need to managed along with other aspects of my health in a more all rounded approach. Health is more than just physical but it also has mental aspects to and to neglect one is at the expense of the other.</p>

                    <p>I know this might seem obscure and abstract, but let me elaborate. A doctor once told me that and Eating Disorder doesn’t mean you wither and die, it is life threatening at any point. Sometimes the people who are more likely to die are not those who have a lower BMI than you. This got me to thinking, while it is important to not have a dangerously low BMI, the focus on weight and BMI is incorrect. If you don’t have to wither and die for an eating disorder to be fatal, then an eating disorder is like a burning candle, a person can only take so much, and like a candle run out of wax and wick too quick and snuff out, however, like a candle a slight gust of wind can  also snuff it out as well.</p>

                    <h2>Recovery and Books...
                        <br>

                    </h2>
                    <p>Recently I was asked about posting my thoughts on books I’ve read and am reading about recovery and eating disorders in general. I am more than happy to do this, however it got me thinking. I have spent a lot of time reading about eating disorders, hoping to find some book that could show me the right path to take for recovery. The problem is, there isn’t one. Everyone’s recovery is individual to them, and as such no one book is going to suffice really, as only parts of certain books will truly strike a chord with the reader. That isn’t to say you wont understand what they mean or wont find yourself nodding along as they explain eating disorders and behaviours and find yourself thinking, ‘they know!’ and ‘they understand’</p>
